# MadLab
A group of short projects developed via Codecademy
LEARN C#

In C#, variables and string interpolation allow us to transform a piece of 
text by swapping out different pieces of information.

In this project, we’ll use C# to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs are 
short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different 
parts of speech. The end result is a really hilarious and strange story.

# Instructions:

For this project, we have provided the story, but it will be up to you to 
complete the following: Prompt the user for inputs. Print the story with the 
inputs in the right places.

It’s important to note that for this project, you should test your app 
periodically — when you hit save, your app will not run! 
To run your app, enter dotnet run into the terminal.
